# Rhythm101 - User's manual
## Group 402 - CEM - Team 4
This videogame was developed using Unity (Editor Version: 2021.2.11f1) on Windows.

## Executable for Windows and Mac
### Windows:
In order to play the final version of our videogame on Windows, download the folder containing all the Windows source files that are located inside the 'exe' folder in this repository, and run the corresponding executable program in your local machine.
### Mac:
In order to play the final version of our videogame on Mac, download the whole folder (Rhythm101MacBuild) into a zip file on [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/197y9w9TSST1nSt88pipbA3EhqMkjpmCl?usp=sharing) from Google Drive into your local machine. Locate the zip file in your computer
(Normally Apple opens a folder with the files, that doesn't execute the app correctly, and throws the necessary zip file in the trash bin). If this is the case, move the zip file into another location on your computer, decompress it manually, and run the .app executable directly.

## Edit or modify the videogame.

_Note: In order to export a runnable version for MacOS, we had to build it from a device with the same Operating System. Therefore, we highly recommend that you have both Windows and MacOS devices ready to export a functional version of this videogame._

## Elements to consider
* In order to play the videogame, a WiFi Connection is required in order to send and store players' data and progress.
* The videogame can be edited with another Unity Editor version, but it is preferable to install the version mentioned above.
* Users' progress will be saved in digital server, therefore they could play the videogame in different networks and devices.
* The web server address (DigitalOcean) where data is sent can be changed in Assets -> Scripts
* In order to function correctly, the folder and all its elements (not only the executable) produced in the build phase need to be together.
* Details on the web server, the API and database are explained in the [Rhythm101 API repository](https://github.com/pablogonzalezdelaparra/rhythm101)
